# at85_flasher

A simple little project that flashes 4 different LEDs on an AT85, where the rate of flashing is
set by the position of a potentiometer.

This is designed to be built into little projects that require flashing LEDs.

Each LED flashes at half the rate of the previous LED (it's just a binary counter).

The rate is changeable from 1ms to 1023ms.
